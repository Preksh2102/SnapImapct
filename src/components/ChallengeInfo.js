      <h2>Challenge Guidelines</h2>
      <div className="card"><h3>Upcycled Fashion</h3><ul><li>Say goodbye to single-use plastics for a day! Carry your own bottle, avoid plastic bags, and inspire others by showing how easy it is. Snap a picture of your sustainable swap — whether it's a reusable cup or bamboo cutlery. Every small action adds up, and your photo could be the one that sparks a chain reaction. Be the hero our oceans need!</li></ul></div>
      <div className="card"><h3>Zero Waste Day</h3><ul><li>Spread joy by doing something kind and unexpected. Whether it’s helping a friend, picking up litter, or leaving a thank-you note — capture the moment. Your act of kindness can remind others that compassion is powerful. This world could use more smiles, and your image might be the spark. Kindness isn’t small — it’s revolutionary.</li></ul></div>
      <div className="card"><h3>Nature Walk Pic</h3><ul><li>Get outside and reconnect with nature — no filter needed. Explore a park, a beach, or even your own garden and snap a photo of something beautiful or wild. From tiny insects to breathtaking views, show us what the planet looks like through your eyes. Remind the world what we’re protecting. Let nature do the talking — just press the shutter.</li></ul></div>
